- 👋 Hi, I’m @pauloL0pes
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, music, technology, and geeks stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C language, Machine Learning, React JS, and maybe more if it fits my agenda (I like to learn new things).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I may know something about it. If someone has a good idea, why not?
- 📫 How to reach me? You can call me by my email: paulosousasancheslopes@gmail.com (I'm working on some other ways to contact me)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: That's a hard question, what should I say? I am a cuber (aka a rubik's cube enjoyer), I (kind of) play the piano (music is my passion), my favorite snack is a nice hamburger and I'm a volleyball enjoyer (I'm more of a opposite hitter or a outside hitter, but I'm not a professional). And that's all for now, go hydrate your self!
