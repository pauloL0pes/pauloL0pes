- 👋 Hi, I’m @pauloL0pes
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, music, technology, and geeks stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C language, Machine Learning, React JS, and may be more if I find some time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I may know something about it. If it's a good idea, why not?
- 📫 How to reach me? You can call me by my email: paulosousasancheslopes@gmail.com (I'm working on some other ways to contact me)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: That's a hard question, what should I say? I know how to solve the rubik's cube, I (kind of) know how to play the piano, I like volleyball too (I also play), my favorite snack is a nice hamburger. There is a lot to say about myself, I just can't decide what to write lol, so I guess that's it for today :) Go hydrate yourself!
